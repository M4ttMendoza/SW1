		<div class="rounded text-danger text-justify col-xl-12">Over three decades after being defeated by Daniel LaRusso in the 1984 All-Valley Karate Tournament in The Karate Kid (1984), Johnny Lawrence, now in his 50s, suffers from alcoholism and depression. He works as a part-time handyman, and lives in an apartment in Reseda, Los Angeles, having fallen far from the wealthy lifestyle in Encino that he had been accustomed to growing up. He has an estranged son named Robby from a previous relationship, whom he has abandoned. In contrast, Daniel is now the owner of a highly successful car dealership chain, and is married to co-owner Amanda with whom he has two children: Samantha and Anthony. Daniel is finally living the wealthy lifestyle he envied as a kid when he and his mother Lucille lived in Reseda. However, after his friend and mentor Mr. Miyagi died, Daniel's struggle to meaningfully connect with his children has disrupted the balance in his life.</div>

		<div class="col-xl-8">Daniel LaRusso was born in Newark, New Jersey on December 18, 1966, into an Italian-American family. When he was eight years old, his father David LaRusso died after a 2-year battle with stomach cancer. Daniel's mother Lucille never remarried. In September 1984, Daniel and Lucille moved to Reseda, California, after Lucille accepted a job offer at a computer firm. Shortly after moving to California, Daniel meets and starts a rivalry with Johnny Lawrence, the two-time winner of the All Valley Under-18 Karate Championship after Daniel befriended his ex-girlfriend Ali Mills. Luckily for Daniel, after being jumped by Johnny and his friends, he met Mr. Miyagi, the maintenance man at his apartment, who becomes his karate mentor and also a very good friend of his, as well as a father figure. It's through this training that Daniel became skilled enough to defeat Johnny in the tournament's final match and become the new champion. Despite their mutual respect afterwards, Daniel and Johnny become rivals.</div>

		<div class="col-xl-8">Johnny Lawrence was born on August 20, 1966. He knew his father for a short while in his life, before he left the family for unknown reasons when Johnny was five years old. Johnny moved to the upscale neighborhood of Encino, California, after his mother, Laura married Sid Weinberg, an executive producer for Lorimar Television. A friendless Johnny was often verbally abused by his stepfather, especially after quitting drums, rollerskating, and magic lessons. As a result, Johnny would use his Walkman to drown out Sid's heckling. One day in 1979, while riding his bicycle, a 12-year-old Johnny discovered the Cobra Kai dojo and spent the next five years learning Tang Soo Do karate under sensei John Kreese.</div>
